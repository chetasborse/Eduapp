## 🔠 Description

The learning environment for most school students is restricted by a standardized curriculum that
reflects very little of what is going on in the real world. Many students are curious but the school curriculum and time table is too restrictive for them to explore in depth at school. There is a lack of quality teachers or even students’ discomfort with
the medium of instruction that makes students lose interest in some subjects. Many experienced people in academia have a passion for teaching but are unable to make commitments because of other demands of senior positions.

We can leverage the entire community of passionate teachers from all different
backgrounds and locations. With OpenSchool, we want to initiate open discussions with reliable
mentors to facilitate the education of school students.
